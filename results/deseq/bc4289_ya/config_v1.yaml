## Configuration file for RNAseq and DEseq pipelines
## Used in ErcanLab_RNA-seq_analysis_v2.docx and ErcanLab_DE-seq_analysis_v1.docx protocols
## found in Ercan's lab google drive.
##
## Author: Diogo Mesquita - dam740@nyu.edu
##
## Usage:
##   Edit this configuration with the values for your analysis.
##   The only fields that you probably do NOT need to change are 'c_elegans_wbid_to_gene',
##   'c_elegans_annots' and 'sbatch_scripts'.
##
##   All replicates should be added to the 'infiles' list as a separate element.
##
##   Elements of 'infiles' must have:
##       - id:        unique identifier of biological replicate. Technical replicates
##                    must have the same id
##       - condition: condition name. These are generic, all replicates from
##                    the same condition should have the same "condition"
##       - type:      must only take one of two values: "control" or "treatment"
##       - fastq:     fastq file name (can be or not gzipped; do NOT include path to file)
